# sheet-tracker-extension

This project involves the development of a Chrome extension that integrates with Google Sheets to track various items, initially designed to automate my job application tracking process. Below is a demonstration of how I use the extension.

Currently, the extension is loaded as an unpacked version for personal use, so it is not available in the Chrome Web Store.

## Current Core Features
- **Sheet selection**: Choose from a list of available Google Sheets.
- **Automated data entry**: Automatically input dates and website URLs.
- **Manual input**: Enter or paste titles, descriptions, and notes.
- **Status tracking**: Track progress with statuses (todo, submitted, qualified, passed, failed).
- **Conditional formatting**: Apply formatting based on the selected status when the "Apply Conditional Formatting" box is checked.

## Future Enhancements
- **User instructions**: Provide detailed steps for users to create their own version of the extension.
- **Custom formatting**: Enable users to define and apply their own conditional formatting rules.
- **Dynamic sheet IDs**: Allow users to dynamically select and specify sheet IDs, eliminating the need for hard-coded values.
- **File and sheet creation**: Add functionality for users to create new Google Sheets files and add new sheets with custom titles directly from the extension.
